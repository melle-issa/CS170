# CS170
## Introduction
This is our code for Project 1 for CS170 Spring 2023. We have implemented Uniform Cost, A* with Misplaced Tile, and A* with Euclidean Distance searching algorithms in order to solve the 8 puzzle. 
## Making Alterations
In order to expand the puzzle to work with different sizes, all that needs to be done is to change the goal state and default puzzle, alter the print board method to print out a larger board, and change the range of numbers we check for in the expanding functions.
